On Friday October 18th, a strong low pressure system developed on a cold front over the DelMarVa Peninsula.  With a high pressure system in place across Northern New England, the low slowly intensified and moved slowly off the Southern New Jersey Coast during Saturday October 19th.

The increasing difference in pressures caused strong and gusty east winds, which also transported abundant moisture from the Atlantic Ocean across the region.  Heavy flood producing rains along with minor to major coastal flooding occurred.

Rain began during the early morning on the 19th and ended shortly after midnight on the 20th.  Three to five inches of rain fell, with isolated higher amounts.

Heavy rain caused serious widespread street and poor drainage flooding:  Rte. 218 between Cornwall and Highland Falls (Orange County) was closed due to flooding.  In Westchester County, flooding caused the closures of the Hutchinson River Parkway between Wolfs Lane and East 3rd Street and the Bronx River Parkway between Sprain Brook Parkway and Scarsdale Road.  Serious street flooding was reported on many other roads including South Street (around the South Street Seaport) in Manhattan,  the Belt Parkway in Kings County and the Long Island Expressway along Nassau and Suffolk Counties.

Heavy rain also caused river flooding:  The Mahwah River at Suffern was above its' 4 foot  flood stage from 8:30 pm on the 19th through 6:30 pm on the 20th.  Its' crest stage was 5.22 feet at 4:30 am on the 20th.
 
In Queens, while a plane was landing in heavy rain and strong gusty winds, it hit some approach lights on the side of the runway.  After that, the nosegear collapsed and it started to skid and came to a stop at the east end of the airport.  Four of 63 people on Delta Flight 554 suffered minor injuries while they evacuated the plane.  Flushing and Springfield Gardens, two low-lying areas with inadequate drainage systems were particularly hit hard by heavy rains.  Serious flooding of basements and first floors caused damaged to 226 homes in Flushing and 70 homes in Springfield Gardens.  Numerous cars were also damaged in flood waters.

Here are selected rainfall amounts for:

New York City:  from 3.10 inches at Kennedy Airport to 4.78 inches in Northeast Flushing.  At Central Park, 4.35 inches was measured, which set a new daily record.

On Friday October 18th, a strong low pressure system developed on a cold front over the DelMarVa Peninsula.  With a high pressure system in place across Northern New England, the low slowly intensified and moved slowly off the Southern New Jersey Coast during Saturday October 19th.

The increasing difference in pressures caused strong and gusty east winds, which also transported abundant moisture from the Atlantic Ocean across the region.  Heavy flood producing rains along with minor to major coastal flooding occurred.

Rain began during the early morning on the 19th and ended shortly after midnight on the 20th.  Three to five inches of rain fell, with isolated higher amounts.

Heavy rain caused serious widespread street and poor drainage flooding:  Rte. 218 between Cornwall and Highland Falls (Orange County) was closed due to flooding.  In Westchester County, flooding caused the closures of the Hutchinson River Parkway between Wolfs Lane and East 3rd Street and the Bronx River Parkway between Sprain Brook Parkway and Scarsdale Road.  Serious street flooding was reported on many other roads including South Street (around the South Street Seaport) in Manhattan,  the Belt Parkway in Kings County and the Long Island Expressway along Nassau and Suffolk Counties.

Heavy rain also caused river flooding:  The Mahwah River at Suffern was above its' 4 foot  flood stage from 8:30 pm on the 19th through 6:30 pm on the 20th.  Its' crest stage was 5.22 feet at 4:30 am on the 20th.
 
In Queens, while a plane was landing in heavy rain and strong gusty winds, it hit some approach lights on the side of the runway.  After that, the nosegear collapsed and it started to skid and came to a stop at the east end of the airport.

An intense narrow band of torrential rain developed within a large area of steady rain.  Rain fell on a frozen ground surface at rates as high as 3 inches per hour.

Widespread rain developed just north of a warm front that remained nearly stationary just south of the area.  Scattered thunderstorms produced torrential rain that caused significant and serious urban flash flooding across New York, Bronx, and Southern Westchester Counties.  Less serious flooding occurred across Northwest Queens and Rockland Counties.  Flash flooding crippled mass transit at the height of the morning rush hour in the New York Metro area.

During the afternoon, torrential rain caused urban flash flooding across parts of Western and Central Suffolk County.  Around 2 feet of water covered Main Street in Northport and up to 4 feet of water flooded many roads across Central Suffolk County , mainly in a band from Shirley north across Manorville to Wading River, where the heaviest rain fell.

Subway service was severely disrupted as 3 to 5 feet of water collected at subway station locations.  Fifty-two inches of water was measured at the 6 line station at Cypress Ave.  A 10 to 20 foot section of the northbound platform on the 6 line at 28th street crumbled and washed away.

In Bronx County, in addition to many road closures, the Metro-North Railroad system was forced to close in Mott Haven, South Bronx, which went under water.  Ten trains carrying thousands of passengers were stranded.

In Southern Westchester County, parts of many roads such as Bronx River Parkway, Hutchinson River Parkway, and Saw Mill River Parkway were forced to close.

On Sunday, June 17th, abundant moisture from the remnants of tropical storm Allison, combined with a cold front approaching from the west, produced extremely heavy rainfall across much of southeast New York during the early morning hours.  Rainfall rates of up to 3 inches per hour produced widespread street and highway flooding, in addition to some flash flooding of small streams.  Some rivers approached or even slightly exceeded flood stage during this heavy rain event.

Heavy rain first affected portions of Rockland and Westchester Counties between 3:30 AM and 6 AM EDT.  The area of heavy rain then slowly shifted east, across New York City around mid morning through midday, Nassau and western Suffolk Counties from late morning through early afternoon, and across central and eastern Suffolk County during the early to mid afternoon hours.  

In Rockland County, the Mahwah River at Suffern crested at 3.79 feet at 10:15 AM EDT, remaining just below its' flood stage of 4.0 feet. However, widespread flooding of streets occurred during the morning hours in Rockland County, closing several major roads which became impassable due to the excessive rainfall.  Several houses were also evacuated due to flooding conditions, particularly near Valley Cottage.

Excessive rainfall also led to severe flooding conditions across portions of Westchester County.  In Greenburgh, 23 residential structures experienced basement flooding, causing thousands of dollars of property damage in the Babbitt Court area.  In Ossining, the Sparta Brook overflowed its' banks around 5 AM EDT, washing away a backyard and flooding an adjoining basement and garage.  Flooding also was reported in Mt. Kisco, particularly near Shoppers Park, where several stores reported damage from the flooding.  Damage to several municipal buildings was also reported in other portions of downtown Mt. Kisco.   

There were also numerous reports of street and highway flooding in the New York City area, as well as Nassau and Suffolk Counties on Long Island, which led to several major road and highway closings.

On Monday, August 13th, a weak cold front approached southeast New York from the west.  In advance of the front, a warm, moist, and very unstable air mass was in place.  As a weak sea breeze developed within this air mass, showers and thunderstorms developed.  With abundant moisture in place, very heavy rainfall accompanied these thunderstorms, with rainfall rates in excess of 2 inches per hour occurring across portions of northern Queens County and northern Nassau County.  In addition, with weak steering winds in place, these showers and thunderstorms moved very slowly, producing highly localized rainfall amounts of 5 inches or more.  Consequently, flooding of roadways and highways occurred in highly localized portions of northern Queens and northern Nassau Counties.  

In northern Queens County, isolated severe flooding occurred along the Cross Island Parkway and Whitestone Expressway, leading to eventual shutdown of these major arterial highways.  Victims were stranded in vehicles on these highways and on other local roads in northern Queens.  In addition, several health care facilities were flooded, including one area hospital and seven area nursing homes.

In Nassau County, heavy rains and flooding washed out several hundred feet of track bed on the Long Island Railroad's Port Jefferson branch, causing derailment of a non-passenger equipment train and stranding thousands of evening rush-hour commuters in Hicksville.  The accident was attributed to the overflowing of a recharge basin in Syosset, which created a 15 foot-deep hole under the track bed.

In Suffolk County, localized flooding was reported in Huntington.  On Main Street, several businesses reported basement flooding as heavy rains, combined with a broken sidewalk, led to the penetration of water into basements.  Up to 3 feet of water were reported in some basements.",52
